| Driver PWA (React + Vite) | Done | Login, dashboard, delivery detail, offline sync, route map |
| Docker Compose (all services) | Done | postgres, redis, backend, dashboard, nominatim, osrm, signal, pwa |
| Guided setup wizard | Done | 5-step first-run: account, region, provision, notifications, security |
| Settings-driven map provisioning | Done | Operating region → auto-downloads correct state/metro extract |
| scripts/setup.sh interactive installer | Done | Generates secrets, .env, starts containers |

## Phase 2: Mapping, Routing & Air-Gap -- MOSTLY DONE

| Feature | Status | Notes |
|---------|--------|-------|
| Pre-built OSRM on GCS (safecare.app) | Done | 50 states + 50 metros, quarterly builds, ~$0.50/build |
| OSRM routing container | Done | Docker service, MLD algorithm, pre-built or viewport-trimmed |
| Self-hosted Nominatim geocoding | Done | Local import only; fails closed until ready |
| Viewport-based operating region | Done | Map viewport IS the region, auto-selects best pre-built match |
| Region size estimation + RAM warnings | Done | Live estimate, color-coded (green/amber/red) |
| GPS-aware route ordering | Done | Nearest stop to driver first, then nearest-neighbour chain |
| Driver position in route geometry | Done | OSRM route starts from driver's GPS, not just first stop |
| Admin map view for zones (Leaflet/OSM) | Done | Interactive polygon drawing, click/drag |
| Address picker with geocoding in recipient form | Done | Search + pin-drop + reverse geocode + zone overlay |
| Offline map tiles in driver PWA | Done | Service worker CacheFirst, tile pre-caching on route download |
| Route geometry display (polyline) | Done | OSRM driving directions rendered on Leaflet map |
| GPS tracking in driver PWA | Done | Live position on map via watchPosition |
| Airplane mode reminder | Done | Geofenced proximity detection, dismissible banner, loud audio alert at 500 m per stop |
| Route packet with tile URLs + bounds | Done | Backend computes tile coverage for pre-caching |
| **Exclusion zones (draw + OSRM edge-weighting)** | **Not done** | Zones page handles delivery zones, not exclusion zones |
| **Route variation between delivery cycles** | **Not done** | Same route every time currently |
| PWA client-side encryption | Done | Server generates session key on route download, client derives AES-GCM-256 via HKDF. Key in sessionStorage (volatile). Route data encrypted in IndexedDB. QR backup for offline recovery. |
| Remote wipe (admin spike) | Done | Backend API + driver-side detection + emergency purge + dashboard "Revoke" button per driver in dispatch view. |
| Panic erase (driver) | Done | Long-press "Erase" button on Dashboard. Instant local destroy — no network, no confirmation. |
| Session key re-issue | Done | `GET /api/driver/session-key` re-issues from Redis after tab close (online recovery). |
| Off-disk DEK (server encryption key) | Done | DEK never written to .env or disk. Loaded into memory via QR code unlock on each boot. Seized server = unreadable database. |
| RPi appliance provisioner | Done | Flask captive portal: WiFi setup, device password, key gen + QR, Docker startup. Hands off to dashboard wizard. |
| Dashboard unlock screen | Done | QR scanner + manual hex entry to unlock system on each boot. 423 Locked on PII endpoints until unlocked. |
| WiFi recovery AP | Done | Auto-detects lost WiFi on boot. After 60s, starts SafeCare-Recovery AP for reconfiguration. No SSH needed. |
| pi-gen SD card image | Done | Custom pi-gen stage: pre-pulled Docker images, systemd services, hostapd/dnsmasq, Avahi mDNS |
| **Full client-side data purge (SQLCipher/keychain)** | **Not done** | No hardware-backed key expiry; purge uses IndexedDB clear + sessionStorage + tile cache |

## Cross-Cutting Gaps

| Gap | Priority | Notes |
|-----|----------|-------|
| Exclusion zones | High | Draw "avoid" areas on map, OSRM edge-weighting. Currently zones are delivery-only. |
| Communication proxy (blind number pool) | High | Proxy so drivers/recipients never see each other's real numbers. Schema exists, no proxy logic. |
| Tailscale / tunnel networking | High | Recommended deployment documented in docs/REMOTE-ACCESS.md. Admin should stay private; public host should expose only driver + webhook paths. |
| Route variation | Medium | Same driver gets same route pattern every time. |
| Push notification remote wipe | Medium | Current wipe uses polling. Push would be instant even with app backgrounded. |
| Team gamification | Low | Fun team names for morale. |
